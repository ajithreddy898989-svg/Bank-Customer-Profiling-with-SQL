# 🏦 Bank Customer Profiling with SQL
## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **bank customer and account data** using **SQL** and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.  
It demonstrates the design of relational database tables, data insertion, and execution of advanced SQL queries to derive insights on customer behavior, transactions, and account relationships.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create and manage bank-related database tables.
- Perform SQL queries to analyze account balances, transactions, and customer relationships.
- Join multiple tables to extract meaningful insights.
- Explore data consistency and linkage across multiple relational tables.

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered
- **Database Design & Normalization**
- **Data Insertion & Manipulation**
- **Joins, Aggregations, and Filtering**
- **Date-based Transaction Analysis**
- **Account Relationship Mapping**

## 💡 SQL Analysis Questions
The project explores multiple SQL query scenarios, such as:
1. Calculate average account balance per customer.  
2. Substitute missing balance amounts using credit card transactions.  
3. Retrieve transactions during March–April 2020.  
4. Exclude specific months from analysis.  
5. Identify first-quarter transactions.  
6. Display messages for customers with “SAVINGS” accounts.  
7. Deduct negative transactions from balances (for Primary relationships).  
8–11. Explore account linkages, transaction rollups, and cross-linked summaries.
